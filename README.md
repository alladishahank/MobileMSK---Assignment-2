This is all the relevant files for assignement 2. I have worked on two repositories - sensor motion and awesome human pose estimation. For awesome human pose estimation 
I have read to papers and summarized them as well as ran some code from a blog and recorded it.
For the sensor motion repo I have tun all the necessary code given in the repo and recorded a video of myself exlpaining how it works. I have also given a short summary,
of the tutorial notebook from the repo.
