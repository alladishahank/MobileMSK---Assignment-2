The code  in the GitHub repo demonstrates the use of the "sensormotion" package to analyze motion data from sensors. This package includes various functions for analyzing gait (walking) and physical activity. 
 The code starts by installing the "sensormotion" package using the "pip" package manager. After installation, necessary dependencies such as "matplotlib", "numpy" and "scipy" are imported.  
 The first part of the code focuses on gait analysis. It generates simulated motion data in three axes: medio-lateral (ML), vertical (VT), and anterior-posterior (AP). The data is plotted using the "matplotlib" command to visualize movement patterns. 
  The Sensormotion package is then used to plot the same signals with additional editing capabilities. Next, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is applied to the vertical (VT) signal and the frequency is plotted. 
  A filter is built into motion signals to remove noise. The filtered signals are superimposed on the new graph with the original signals. 
 Filtered VT signal peaks and corresponding peak times are identified using the "sensormotion" peak detection function. These vertices represent the steps taken while walking.  
 The code calculates various walking parameters such as  number of steps, cadence (steps per minute), average step time and step time variability. These parameters give an idea of ​​the walking pattern.  Moving on to physical activity analysis, simulated movement data is generated over a longer period of time. The motion signals are changed at different time points to simulate different intensities of motion. 
 The motion signals are plotted using the "sensormotion" function and then the number of action cycles for each axis is calculated using the "convert_counts" function. The data is corrected, integrated and aggregated into 60-second periods. 
 The size of the vector  is calculated based on the number of bursts of activity on each axis. This shows the general level of activity. 
 The "sensormotion" cutpoints feature is used to classify time spent at different activity intensity levels.The categories (sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous) and the corresponding time  in each category are shown. 
 In summary, the "sensormotion" package provides a set of tools for analyzing sensor motion data. The code shows how to generate motion signals, visualize them, filter the signals, identify peaks in step analysis and classify physical activity  levels. Using the package, researchers and practitioners can get an overview of walking habits and measure the level of physical activity  based on movement data from sensors.
